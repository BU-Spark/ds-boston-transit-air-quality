3. Have we run into any issues? Do we need help?
Having issues pulling data from links provided:
- "https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/7ee4b278406445d7b8d487a49a2d88d9"
- "https://boston.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?layers=fda29d2d98ff427588064375c5c9afe5"
We think the creator of the maps did not enable data download.

Spoke to the TPM last lab (10/12), let them know about the issues with the base project data and gave the TA a status update. Will check in with the TPM and TA next lab (10/19)
