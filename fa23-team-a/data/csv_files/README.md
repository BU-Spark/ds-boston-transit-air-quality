#### <ins>MAPC Health and Pollution Proximity Intensity Data</ins>
- File name: [mapc_population_proximity_index.csv](fa23-team-a/data/csv_files/mapc_population_proximity_index.csv).
- Description: This dataset encapsulates the demographic distribution within Boston's 250-meter grid cells and associates each cell with a Pollution Proximity Intensity (PPI) score.
- Data content: Populational statistics by race within the designated grid cells are coupled with a PPI score, indicating the level of exposure to vehicle emission-related pollutants, predominantly nitrogen oxides (NOx).
- Source: The data is compiled and made available by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC).

    `Summary:` The MAPC Health and PPI dataset is a vital resource for analyzing the intersection of urban demographics and environmental stressors, such as air pollution from vehicular emissions. The PPI scores offer a nuanced understanding of pollution exposure risks, which can significantly affect public health, especially in densely populated urban areas. By cross-referencing the PPI scores with health outcome data, researchers can identify patterns and trends, potentially guiding public policy and urban development towards healthier living environments.
