- File name: [mapc_population_proximity_index.csv](fa23-team-a/data/csv_files/mapc_population_proximity_index.csv).
- Description: A shapefile of the 250-meter gridded population data tied with Pollution Proximity Intensity (PPI) scores.
- Data content: The dataset merges demographic data by race with a Pollution Proximity Intensity (PPI) score, which is a compound index reflecting the intensity of vehicle emissions, specifically nitrogen oxides (NOx), around roadways.
- Source: Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) and the Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH).
- Access: [DataCommon - MAPC](https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/413).

    `Summary:` This dataset is part of a comprehensive study conducted across the MAPC region, focusing on the residential proximity to high-pollution roads â€” particularly those within a 250-meter range. The study introduced the Pollution Proximity Index (PPI), which integrates traffic volume and proximity to pollution sources into a singular measure. Areas with elevated PPI scores are typically characterized by heavy road traffic, including significant freight and diesel vehicle flows.
