1. What is the project focus/overall goal?
A.The overall goal of this project is to derive insights that help guide policy decisions aimed at reducing air pollution and improving public health in Boston. The focus is to evaluate the yearly change in air quality and its correlation with the demographic characteristics of residents, their proximity to different types of transport infrastructures, and their health impacts. We will further explore potential patterns or inferences and delve into identifying areas with the best or worst isolated air pollution problems, their health impacts, and the relationship to traffic data and transit performance.
