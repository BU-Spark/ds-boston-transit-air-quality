## Project Description
Transportation holds a significant role in enhancing the well-being of Massachusetts and Boston residents, impacting economic development, environmental aspects, and equity. The decisions a city makes regarding its transportation infrastructure can notably influence air quality and climate conditions. In Massachusetts, about two-thirds of pollutant emissions stem from fossil fuel-powered vehicles, underlining the urgency of sustainable transportation choices. Notably, utilizing alternative energy sources such as electricity and hydrogen for public transport vehicles like buses and trains can mitigate emissions, resulting in decreased air pollution and improved urban air quality.

Poor air quality poses health risks, particularly affecting marginalized communities, with consequences including elevated rates of pediatric asthma, lung diseases, cancer, and heart disease. In recognition of these challenges, the City of Boston has collaborated with BU Spark! to comprehensively assess the impact of transportation infrastructure on air quality within the city. Our semester project involves crafting a data-driven report, analyzing air quality in Boston and exploring the intricate relationship between public transportation, car infrastructure, and usage patterns.

## Project Goal
The primary objective of our project is to explore the impact of Boston's transportation systems, including buses and roads, on air quality. We aim to understand how air quality varies across the city over time, particularly in relation to transit access. Crucially, we're examining the interplay of this air quality data with demographic aspects such as race and ethnicity, income levels, housing and population density, and social vulnerability. Our goal is to unravel the complex ties between transportation, air quality, and public health in the context of Boston.

## Questions Answered

# Base Question
How do areas with poor air quality compare to areas with better air quality based on different demographic characteristics, specifically:
- Race/ethnicity (ACS)
- Area median income/ income
- Housing density
- Population density
- Social vulnerability 

# Extension Question
What is the relationship between the community types (municipalities mapping to community types) in Boston and the PPI data with regards to race distributions, median income, and MBTA infrastructure?
