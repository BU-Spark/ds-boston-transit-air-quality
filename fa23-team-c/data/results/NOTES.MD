2. **Mature Suburbs** and **Regional Urban Centers** 
3. **Developing Suburbs** 





PPI essentially measures the proximity of certain areas to sources of pollution. A higher PPI suggests closer proximity to pollution sources, which might imply a higher risk of exposure to pollutants. A lower PPI indicates a farther distance from pollution sources, suggesting potentially cleaner air and less direct exposure to pollutants.


1. **Inner Core**: The fact that the "Inner Core" commute type has the highest average PPI suggests that these central urban areas might be closer to sources of pollution. This could be due to factors like dense traffic, industrial activities, and a higher concentration of buildings and infrastructure. Residents and workers in these areas may have a higher risk of exposure to pollutants. Has the highest average PPI, exceeding 3.0.

2. **Mature Suburbs and Regional Urban Centers**: These areas have a moderate PPI. This could indicate that while they are not as densely packed or industrialized as the Inner Core, they still have significant urban development and associated pollution sources. There's a balance between urbanization and open spaces, which might result in a moderate level of pollution exposure. Both have average PPI values between 1.5 and 2.5, with Mature Suburbs slightly lower than Regional Urban Centers. 

3. **Developing Suburbs**: The lowest average PPI for Developing Suburbs suggests these areas are farther from major pollution sources. They might be characterized by newer developments, open spaces, fewer industrial activities, and less traffic congestion. As such, residents in these areas might experience cleaner air and a reduced risk of pollution exposure. Has the lowest average PPI, which is below 1.0.


"Inner Core" tend to have higher exposure to pollution as indicated by their PPI, while "Developing Suburbs" appear to have the least exposure. The other commute types fall in between these two extremes.
