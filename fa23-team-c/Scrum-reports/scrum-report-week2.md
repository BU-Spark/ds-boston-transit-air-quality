## What have we worked on?
As a team, we have studied the background readings and videos for the Air Quality + Transit project to get a general idea for the types of questions and important information to pay attention to moving forward. We have begun work on Deliverable 1 by performing preliminary analysis on the provided base project data and getting an overall understanding of the resources given to us.

## What will we be working on next?
We will continue to work on the Deliverable 1 submission due on November 1st. In particular, our primary objectives for this week will be to complete our overview of the base project data and select two key questions from those provided in the project description document to narrow our focus. In future weeks, we will analyze the base project data in the context of those two key questions and answer them for Deliverable 1.

Next meeting date: Friday, October 13th.

## Have we run into any issues? Do we need help?
The client for the Air Quality + Transit project is listed as the “City of Boston.” Who will be our point of contact for this client? (Spark! Contact? Team Project Manager?)

## Team Lead: Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?
Our point of contact for the client is still unclear, we will send an email to our PM (Bella Davies) to clarify this and get more information as needed.
