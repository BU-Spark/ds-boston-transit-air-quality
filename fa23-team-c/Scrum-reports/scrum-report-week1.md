# Week #1 - Week of 10/2
## What is the project focus/overall goal?
The focus of this project is to understand the impact transportation has on air quality in Boston. We want to investigate the relationship between different transportation including public transportation like trains, subways, and public roads. We also want to investigate if this data is consistent based on different demographic characteristics or not.

## Why is this project important? 
The project is important because Boston’s poor air quality affects the public health of the entire city. Understanding the causes and effects of Boston’s poor air quality will allow the city of Boston to make decisions and policies depending on how it is affecting its citizens as well as the environmental impact it's having on the city.

## What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?
- Proximity to roads (Pollution Proximity Index, PPI)
- Air quality sensor data
- Transit Data
- Census data for demographics
- Social vulnerability index
- Area median income data
- MBTA public transit data, Traffic data, performance (for extension project part)

## What are potential limitations of the project?
Not all data relevant to our project will be readily available to us, so we will be limited by the amount of data we can use from MBTA and Spark! resources.

The scope of our project is limited just to the Boston area. While it is possible to use our data to predict the effects of transit on air quality in other areas, our findings may not fully fit the specifics of a different area.

There are many potential confounding variables that may interfere with our data collection and analysis. Many factors besides MBTA transit systems affect Boston’s air quality, so much work will be needed in order to remove those confounding variables.

## What are your next steps? Divide tasks amongst the teams.
- Everyone should have a look at the videos provided in the Air Quality + Transit document.
