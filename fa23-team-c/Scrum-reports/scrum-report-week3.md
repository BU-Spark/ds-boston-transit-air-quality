## What have we worked on?
We have continued working on Deliverable 1 and examining the given data sources for our preliminary analysis. In particular, our Spark! TPM got in contact with the City of Boston clients and introduced us to four more sources and APIs to draw data from, so we are especially focusing our efforts on these new sources of information and incorporating them into our analysis.

## What will we be working on next?
For this week, we will continue to collect data and begin working as a group to aggregate our findings and formalize them for Deliverable 1. Our next team meeting will be on 10/27, where we will choose what questions to focus our analysis on and begin composing the document for Deliverable 1.

## Have we run into any issues? Do we need help?
No issues thus far.

## Team Lead: Have I talked to the TPM recently? When are we meeting with them next?
We were recently in contact with the TPM, who provided us with additional context and information surrounding one of our sources, as well as advice on how to make the most out of our sources.
