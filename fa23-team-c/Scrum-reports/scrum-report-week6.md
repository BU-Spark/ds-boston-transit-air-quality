## What have we worked on?
The major progress this week was the extraction of all daily data from AirNow’s 2020-2023 database. Besides that, we all focused on the Kaggle Competition midterm.

## What will we be working on next?
Starting next week, we will begin analyzing the latest daily data we've collected for the years 2020-2023 to observe the yearly changes in air quality, and we will begin work on Checkpoint A, due next Friday.

## Have we run into any issues? Do we need help?
The only issue we faced was with extracting all the necessary data; my computer lost connection at one point, which ended the process, requiring me to restart the bash script to fetch the data. However, after letting it run for a day and ensuring it stayed connected, we were able to complete the task.

## Team Lead: Have I talked to the TPM recently? When are we meeting with them next?
I haven't spoken with the TPM recently since the main focus this week was to work on the midterm. I plan to meet with her soon to discuss Mithat’s message about what the final outcome for the project might look like and to ask some questions my team has about the three other APIs that have been supplied.
