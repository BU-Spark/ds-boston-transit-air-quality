## What have we worked on?
We have continued to work on Deliverable 1. We collected the data from AirNow API for 2021 and have started processing and analyzing it. We also began collecting Census data to investigate how air quality changes based on Race/ethnicity,  Area median income, Housing density, Population density, Social vulnerability. We continued to finalize our findings and completed deliverable 1.

## What will we be working on next?
We will continue to analyze more data if needed, incorporating recommendations and feedback from advisors and TAs from Deliverable 1, as well as beginning work on Checkpoint A.

## Have we run into any issues? Do we need help?
We’ve had difficulties collecting data from different APIs, as the formatting and data structure is not very consistent even within the same dataset. In particular, the AirNow Air Quality Index uses many different forms of measurement units and is very inconsistent with reporting data, leading to a lot of preprocessing necessary to make the data workable.

We also faced a big issue with collecting and filtering data from the Census. Our TPM has informed us that every team has to collect air quality data for only one year, will this be the same with census data?

## Team Lead: Have I talked to the TPM recently? When are we meeting with them next?
Yes, we’ve spoken on Slack about the issues with how exactly we should be collecting the data from the Airnow API. I plan on meeting with her as soon as possible to discuss what we should continue to do.
