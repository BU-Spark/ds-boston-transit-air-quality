## Project Description
Improving air quality is a critical concern in Boston, particularly for marginalized communities that bear the brunt of its adverse effects, resulting in elevated rates of asthma and lung diseases. One potential solution to address poor air quality involves transitioning public transportation to alternative energy sources. This shift holds promise in significantly reducing harmful emissions and stabilizing air quality. However, implementing this transition is a complex undertaking due to the indispensable role transportation plays in the lives of Boston residents. 

Understanding the intricate links between transportation infrastructure, air quality, and residents' health is paramount. Such insights are essential for guiding necessary actions to enact changes in Boston effectively. Moreover, recognizing the profound impact of air quality on the health of Bostonians emphasizes the need to develop policies for a cleaner and more environmentally sustainable city. Recognizing and analyzing the correlations between air quality and overall health outcomes are pivotal in formulating effective strategies. 

Our project encompasses two primary objectives: firstly, to comprehend the correlations and impact of transportation infrastructure on overall air quality in Boston. Secondly, upon establishing a baseline correlation, we aimed to assess health outcomes, such as air quality and the percentage of residents suffering from asthma and lung diseases by zip code.

## Project Goal
Investigate the relationship between transportation infrastructure and its impact on Boston's air quality and climate and surrounding Boston neighborhoods. 

## Questions Answered
  1. What is the yearly change in air quality for Boston residents based on their proximity to different types of transportation infrastructure  specifically, proximity to public transportation options or proximity to roads? 
  2. How do areas with poor air quality compare to areas with better air quality based on different demographic characteristics, specifically: Race/ethnicity (ACS), Area median income/ income, Housing & Population Density, Social vulnerability.
  3. What is the relationship between health data and  What are the trends in yearly change in air quality for Boston residents by neighborhood, zip code.
  4. What is the relationship between these yearly changes in air quality for Boston residents and health outcomes (e.g., asthma rates, lung cancer rates) (Extension Part)

### Base Questions Notebook
In order to run the Analysis.ipynb notebook which contains all the analysis done when exploring the base questions the following datasets are required:
  - 2021_Daily_Aqi_Data_Cleaned.csv
  - 2021_Avg_Aqi_Data_Cleaned.csv
  - census_transport.csv
  - ppi.csv
  - DP03_Cleaned.csv
  - DP02_Cleaned.csv
  - DP05_Cleaned.csv
  - ZIP_Codes.csv

!Make sure to change the file paths of the above files in the notebook to make them work on your local machine since the location of the datasets might be different.

### Extension Part Notebook
In order to run the Deliverable4_Code.ipynb notebook which contains our extension part of the project, the following datasets are required:
  - 2022_Health_Zipcode.csv
  - 2023_Health_Zipcode.csv
  - Boston_Health_20_23.csv
!Make sure to change the file paths of the above files in the notebook to make them work on your local machine since the location of the datasets might be different.
