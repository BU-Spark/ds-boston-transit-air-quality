Goal:

Our project's primary goal is to investigate the relationship between public transportation, air quality, demographic factors, and public health in Boston. We are motivated by the pressing need to understand air quality impacts residents of Boston, particularly in the context of certain communities that often bear the results of poor air quality's health consequences. By analyzing data on air quality, transportation infrastructure, and demographic information, we aim to provide actionable insights that can inform policies, foster equity, and ultimately improve the quality of life for all Boston residents. 

Our project's extended phase delves into exploratory data analysis, seeking to uncover unexpected connections within this complex dataset. We aspire to unveil hidden patterns and correlations that may offer new perspectives on the intersections between air quality, health outcomes, and transit systems. Our main motivation is to unveil insights that can guide evidence-based decision-making and contribute to the broader discourse on sustainable transportation, public health, and social equity.
