# CS-506-TEMPLATE-base-repo

If your project has multiple teams add changes (code, deliverables, data, etc.) to your team folder.

Create a new branch from your team branch, add changes to your team folder (on the new branch you just created).

Open a Pull Request to your team branch (ex. branch name: <code>team-a</code>). Add your TA and TPM as reviewers.  ***Do not delete any team folders.***

At the end of the semester during project wrap up open a final Pull Request to <code>dev</code> from your team branch.
