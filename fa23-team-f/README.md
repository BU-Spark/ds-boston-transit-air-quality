# Boston Air Quality & Transit Team F 
Clearing the Path: Evaluating Air Quality and Sustainable Transportation

## Problem Statement
Air quality is a critical concern for the wellbeing of Boston residents. Poor air quality could be detrimental to public health, causing respiratory issues such as Asthma. To address the issue of air quality around Boston, we are looking at how public transportation can play a crucial role in reducing emissions and increasing air quality. We aim to look at Boston divided into neighborhoods and see the factors behind the variability in air quality to help make guided decisions on where to focus efforts and policies to enhance air quality.
